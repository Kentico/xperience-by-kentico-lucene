    <![CDATA[<p id="isPasted">Taste Natural Barra Grande from the high altitudes of Poco Fundo in Minas Gerais in Brazil, where a family business with a strong keenness on natural processing has been growing coffee for three generations.</p><p><br></p><p>The path of the Barra Grande has not always been so smooth. The father of Sildes Caixeta, the current owner, was forced to sell their company when Sildes was just five years old. After long years of waiting, Sildes managed to buy the company back and now says that this patience is the family secret for growing good coffee and has taught this motto to his son.</p><p><br></p><p>This coffee is a blend of Yellow Catuai and Mundo Novo, whose excellent large beans are patio dried and create a creamy mouth sensation and a cherry flavor with a pinch of chocolate and caramel.</p>]]>
