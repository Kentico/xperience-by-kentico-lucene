# Auto-scaling Support

This integration supports Xperience's [Auto-scaling support](https://docs.kentico.com/x/SI3WCQ). This means that your application can distribute computing among multiple applications and therefore increase the number of requests the project can handle.

The integration indexes and creates files in the file system for each instance of your application. This is done automatically if your application is runnning on multiple instances.
