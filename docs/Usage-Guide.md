# Usage Guide

This library supports using Lucene.NET to index both unstructured and high structured, interrelated content in an Xperience by Kentico solution. This indexed content can then be programmatically queried and displayed in a website channel.

Below are the steps to integrate the library into your solution.

## Create a custom Indexing Strategy

See [Custom index strategy](Custom-index-strategy.md)

## Continuous Integration

When starting your application for the first time after adding this library to your solution, a custom module and custom module classes will automatically be created
to support managing search index configuration within the administration UI.

If you do not see new items added to your [CI repository](https://docs.xperience.io/x/FAKQC) for the new auto-generated Lucene search data types, stop your application and perform a [CI store](https://docs.xperience.io/xp/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration#ContinuousIntegration-Storeobjectdatatotherepository) to add the library's custom module configuration to the CI repository.

You should now be able to run a [CI restore](https://docs.xperience.io/xp/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration#ContinuousIntegration-Restorerepositoryfilestothedatabase).
Attempting to run a CI restore without the CI files in the CI repository will result in a SQL error during the restore.

When team members are merging changes that include the addition of this library, they _must_ first run a CI restore to ensure they have the same object metadata for the search custom module as your database.

Future updates to indexes will be tracked in the CI repository [unless they are excluded](https://docs.xperience.io/x/ygAcCQ).

## Implementing document decay

You can score indexed items by "freshness" or "recency" using several techniques, each with different tradeoffs.

1. Boost relevant fields by setting field boost (preferable method, but requires more work).
2. Boost one field with constant value, that is always present in search query (shown in the example project, less desirable method.

   The Downside of this method is that all documents get matched, usable only for scenarios where total number of result is not required).

3. Use a sort expression. Implementation details can be found in Lucene.NET unit tests, Lucene.NET implementations

> Small differences in boosts will be ignored by Lucene.
